## Assignment 1: Using Machine and Deep Learning to Promote Mood Prediction
In this work, machine learning was evaluated for predicting
mood based on a data gathered from human behaviour on a smartphone.
An extensive approach to data preprocessing, analysis, feature engineer-
ing and model selection has been described. Several machine learning
methods were evaluated and bench-marked on their performance, demon-
strating that the models outperform a naive benchmark.

## Assignment 2: Using Recommendation Algorithms to Promote Ranking of Hotels
n this work, machine learning methods and recommenda-
tion algorithms were evaluated for generating a ranking of recommended
hotels based on a data gathered from user behaviour on Expedia. An ex-
tensive approach to data preprocessing, analysis, feature engineering and
model selection has been described. Several machine learning methods
were evaluated and bench-marked on their performance, demonstrating
that the models outperform a naive benchmark.
