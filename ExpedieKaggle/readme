In this work, machine learning methods and recommendation algorithms were evaluated for generating a ranking of recommended hotels based on a data gathered from user behaviour on Expedia. An extensive approach to data preprocessing, analysis, feature engineering and
model selection has been described. Several machine learning methods were evaluated and bench-marked on their performance, demonstrating that the models outperform a naive benchmark.
