In this work, machine learning methods and recommendation algorithms were evaluated for generating a ranking of recommended
hotels based on a data gathered from user behaviour on Expedia. An extensive approach to data preprocessing, analysis, feature engineering and
model selection has been described. Several machine learning methods
were evaluated and bench-marked on their performance, demonstrating
that the models outperform a naive benchmark.
